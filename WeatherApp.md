## Objective

Use your weapons of choice and build a single page application, which can talk to a weatherAPI for eg (https://openweathermap.org) to show case the location and the weather at that location.
You can use https://www.openstreetmap.org/# or https://developers.google.com/maps/ to show the locations on the Map. 

For this challenge, it doesnt need to have any authentication. Just a single page with two Locations.
 - Helsinki
 - New Delhi

We dont need to see both locations at the same time, but should be able to switch between both. Its up to you how you do it.

**Bonus**: Leave a text box where you can enter your friends email and by clicking a button your friend will be notified about the "beautiful" weather in the location you have chosen. You are free to use free services like MailGun or Amazon SES. Please dont waste any money on paid services :)
